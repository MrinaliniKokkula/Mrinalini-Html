    <h2>Sponge Cake Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>200g (1 cup) granulated sugar</li>
<li>200g (1 2/3 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>100g (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 tbsp milk (optional, for extra moisture)</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Baking Instructions</h3>
<ol>		 
<li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>

<li>For a higher sponge cake, you can use two 8-inch round pans and divide the batter between them.</li>

<li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed for about 5-7 minutes, or until the mixture is thick, pale, and has doubled in volume. This is crucial for getting a light and airy sponge.</li>

<li>In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>

<li>Gently fold the sifted dry ingredients into the egg mixture using a spatula. Be careful not to deflate the batter too much.</li>

<li>Gently fold in the melted butter and vanilla extract until just combined.</li>

<li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan(s) and smooth the top with a spatula.</li>

<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>

<li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting or serving.</li>
<br>Enjoy!</br>
